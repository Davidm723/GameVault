# GameVault

This project was inspired by my own personal game collection. I wanted a place where you can show off your own collection while also being able to explore other user's collections.

## Next Steps

I'd really link to inclue social media functionality to this site. Such as being able to follw other users and keep up with their collections. I'd also like to add a filter feature, so you can sort and filter through games in the collections.
